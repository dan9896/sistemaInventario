# Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and implementation details for the Vue.js application.

## Current Plan

The current goal is to create a main view in `App.vue` with the following elements, all centered on the page:

1.  A main title: "Abarrotes Doña Vilches"
2.  A subtitle: "Bienvenidos al sistema"
3.  A green button with the text: "Acceder al sistema"

I will use modern design principles to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
